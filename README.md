Descriptive Statistics
As there is No missing value in the data, I did graphical representation directly
Two types of analysis performed:
i. Univariate Analysis (used bar graph, box plot and distribution plot(seaborn))
ii. Bivariate Analysis (used relational plot(seaborn), line plot, horizontal bar graph)
Used heatmap to check the correlation among the variables
