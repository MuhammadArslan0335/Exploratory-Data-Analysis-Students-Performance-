Descriptive Statistics
As there is No missing value in the data, I did graphical representation directly
Two types of analysis performed:
i. Univariate Analysis (used bar graph, box plot and distribution plot(seaborn))
ii. Bivariate Analysis (used relational plot(seaborn), line plot, horizontal bar graph)
Used heatmap to check the correlation among the variables

Applied Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine and got 99% Accuracy
